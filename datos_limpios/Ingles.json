Kerry made it clear that he would welcome expanded cooperation with Putin after a meeting here with Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.   Noting that 500 or more Islamic State volunteers may have come from Russia, Kerry said that he had proposed that the two sides intensify intelligence sharing on the militant group and other terrorist threats, and that Lavrov had agreed. Opening the door to cooperation in Iraq, Kerry said Lavrov had agreed to explore whether Russia could do more to support Iraq s beleaguered government as it battles the Islamic State   including by providing weapons.","label":1.0}

There s been more than one case where a brother arrives, leaving Jabhat an-Nusrah and coming to join the Islamic State, and his name is immediately handed over to the Free Syrian Army. Consequently, they [the FSA] make things difficult for his family, or his father is thrown in prison, or they threaten to kill his family. Why? Because he joined the ranks of the Islamic State.  Many of the leaders in Jabhah try to scare their fighters saying,  They [the Islamic State] will kill you. They will do this. They will do that  so they can prevent them from coming here [to the Islamic State]. So I advise everyone in Jabhat an-Nusrah, and in particular those young men whom I trained, to join the ranks of the Islamic State, because it is upon the truth, for it implements the Shar? ah of Allah, carries out the hud?d, and enjoins good and forbids evil.As for when I was in Jabhat an-Nusrah, I did not see implementation of Allah s Shar? ah, nor did I see justice between an am?r and an ordinary member.","label":1.0}

This is the rule because distinguishing the condition of individuals is done if they are maqd?r  alayhim (under the power of Muslims); these individuals are not maqd?r  alayhim. So the obligatory defensive jih?d is not to be disrupted for the sake of distinguishing the condition of individuals  [al-Liq?  al-Maft?h   al-Halqat al-?l?].","label":1.0}

{"Unnamed: 0":134860,"text":"And after some of the Ikhw?n decided to target some Egyptian agents of the British without approval from the top leadership, al-Bann? wrote an official declaration in which he said,  The goal of our da wah when it initiated was to work for the good of the homeland, support the religion, and oppose all calls of atheism, immorality, and abandonment of the laws and virtues of Islam   If this is the case, then murder, terrorism, and violence are not from its means, because it takes Islam as its methodology, abiding by its limits   Pure Islam is the religion of comprehensive peace, complete security, pure spirituality, and the lofty example of humankind    Some events occurred that were attributed to some of those who had entered the jam? ah without having absorbed its spirit. After these frightening events, another event took place, which was the assassination of the Prime Minister Mahm?d Fahm? an-Naqr?sh? Pasha. The country was struck with sorrow due to his passing. It lost by his passing a star of its renaissance, a leader of its progress, a good role model of honesty, patriotism, and chastity. He was one of its best sons. We are no less saddened than others over his passing nor do we admire his jih?d and character less than others do. This is because the nature of the Islamic da wah opposes violence; rather it censures it, abhors murder regardless of its type, and resents its perpetrators. For this reason, we declare our innocence before Allah of the murders and their perpetrators.   Because our country is now passing through a stage that is one of the most significant of its life thus necessitating the providing of complete calm, security, and stability, his majesty the great king   may Allah protect him   was generous and directed the existent government, consisting of the top men of Egypt, to a righteous focus. That was to work to unite the word of the nation and close its ranks and direct its efforts and capacities altogether, not divided, to serve the good of the nation and its internal and foreign reforms. The government immediately began to execute the noble directives with sincerity, character, and honesty. All this makes it obligatory upon us to exert all our strength and spend our time in helping the government in executing and fulfilling its great responsibilities. It will not be able to do so correctly until it is certain that security and stability have been achieved for the regime. This is the obligation upon every citizen in normal times. How much more so is it in these delicate and crucial circumstances in which no one gains from the chaos of emotions, clash of ideas, and division of efforts except the enemies of the nation and its renaissance.   For this reason, I call upon my brothers for the sake of Allah and the public good that each one of them helps in achieving this meaning, directing themselves to their work, and distancing themselves from every deed that opposes the stabilization of security and comprehensiveness of safety, so that they thereby fulfill the right of Allah and the right of the homeland. We ask Allah to protect his majesty the great king and to guide the steps of the country both its government and people under his reign to what entails good and success  [AlIkhw?n al-Muslim?n Ahd?th Sana at atT?r?kh].","label":1.0}
